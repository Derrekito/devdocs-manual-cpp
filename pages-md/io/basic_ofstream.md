# std::basic_ofstream

```cpp
template<
    class CharT,
    class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>
> class basic_ofstream : public std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>
```

The class template `basic_ofstream` implements high-level output operations on
file based streams. It interfaces a file-based streambuffer
(`std::basic_filebuf`) with the high-level interface of (`std::basic_ostream`).

A typical implementation of `std::basic_ofstream` holds only one non-derived
data member: an instance of std::basic_filebuf<CharT, Traits>.

Several typedefs for common character types are provided:

- **`std::ofstream`** — std::basic_ofstream<char>
- **`std::wofstream`** — std::basic_ofstream<wchar_t>

### Member types

- **`char_type`** — `CharT`
- **`traits_type`** — `Traits`; the program is ill-formed if `Traits::char_type`
  is not `CharT`.
- **`int_type`** — `Traits::int_type`
- **`pos_type`** — `Traits::pos_type`
- **`off_type`** — `Traits::off_type`
- **`native_handle_type`(C++26)** — *implementation-defined* type that is
  TriviallyCopyable and `semiregular`

### Member functions

- **(constructor)** — constructs the file stream (public member function)
- **(destructor) [virtual] (implicitly declared)** — destructs the
  `basic_ofstream` and the associated buffer, closes the file (virtual public
  member function)
- **operator= (C++11)** — moves the file stream (public member function)
- **swap (C++11)** — swaps two file streams (public member function)
- **rdbuf** — returns the underlying raw file device object (public member
  function)
- **native_handle (C++26)** — returns the underlying implementation-defined
  handle (public member function)

**File operations**

- **is_open** — checks if the stream has an associated file (public member
  function)
- **open** — opens a file and associates it with the stream (public member
  function)
- **close** — closes the associated file (public member function)

### Non-member functions

- **std::swap(std::basic_ofstream) (C++11)** — specializes the `std::swap`
  algorithm (function template)

### Example

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string filename = "Test.b";
    {
        std::ofstream ostrm(filename, std::ios::binary);
        double d = 3.14;
        ostrm.write(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&d), sizeof d); // binary output
        ostrm << 123 << "abc" << '\n';                      // text output
    }

    // read back
    std::ifstream istrm(filename, std::ios::binary);
    double d;
    istrm.read(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&d), sizeof d);
    int n;
    std::string s;
    istrm >> n >> s;
    std::cout << " read back: " << d << ' ' << n << ' ' << s << '\n';
}
```

Output:

```text
read back: 3.14 123 abc
```
