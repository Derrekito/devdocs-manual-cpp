# std::basic_ostringstream

```cpp
template<
    class CharT,
    class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>,
    class Allocator = std::allocator<CharT>
> class basic_ostringstream
    : public basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>;
```

The class template `std::basic_ostringstream` implements output operations on
string based streams. It effectively stores an instance of `std::basic_string`
and performs output operations to it.

At the low level, the class essentially wraps a raw string device implementation
of `std::basic_stringbuf` into a higher-level interface of `std::basic_ostream`.
The complete interface to unique `std::basic_stringbuf` members is provided.

Several typedefs for common character types are provided:

- **`std::ostringstream`** — std::basic_ostringstream<char>
- **`std::wostringstream`** — std::basic_ostringstream<wchar_t>

### Member types

- **`char_type`** — `CharT`
- **`traits_type`** — `Traits`; the program is ill-formed if `Traits::char_type`
  is not `CharT`.
- **`int_type`** — `Traits::int_type`
- **`pos_type`** — `Traits::pos_type`
- **`off_type`** — `Traits::off_type`
- **`allocator_type`** — `Allocator`

### Exposition-only members

- **`sb`** — the std::basic_stringbuf<CharT, Traits, Allocator> used as the
  underlying buffer (exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

- **(constructor)** — constructs the string stream (public member function)
- **operator= (C++11)** — moves the string stream (public member function)
- **swap (C++11)** — swaps two string streams (public member function)
- **rdbuf** — returns the underlying raw string device object (public member
  function)

**String operations**

- **str** — gets or sets the contents of underlying string device object (public
  member function)
- **view (C++20)** — obtains a view over the contents of underlying string
  device object (public member function)

### Non-member functions

- **std::swap(std::basic_ostringstream) (C++11)** — specializes the `std::swap`
  algorithm (function template)
