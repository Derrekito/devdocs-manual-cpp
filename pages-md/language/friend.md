# Friend declaration

The friend declaration appears in a class body and grants a function or another
class access to private and protected members of the class where the friend
declaration appears.

### Syntax

```text
friend function-declaration    (1)
friend function-definition    (2)
friend elaborated-class-specifier ;    (3)
friend simple-type-specifier ; friend typename-specifier ;    (4)    (since C++11)
```

### Description

1) Designates a function or several functions as friends of this class: class Y
   { int data; // private member // the non-member function operator<< will have
   access to Y's private members friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream&
   out, const Y& o); friend char* X::foo(int); // members of other classes can
   be friends too friend X::X(char), X::~X(); // constructors and destructors
   can be friends }; // friend declaration does not declare a member function //
   this operator<< still needs to be defined, as a non-member std::ostream&
   operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Y& y) { return out << y.data; // can
   access private member Y::data }

2) (only allowed in non-local class definitions) Defines a non-member function,
   and makes it a friend of this class at the same time. Such non-member
   function is always inline, unless it is attached to a named module(since
   C++20). class X { int a; friend void friend_set(X& p, int i) { p.a = i; //
   this is a non-member function } public: void member_set(int i) { a = i; //
   this is a member function } };

3) Designates the class, struct, or union named by the
   elaborated-class-specifier (see elaborated type specifier) as a friend of
   this class. This means that the friend's member declarations and definitions
   can access private and protected members of this class and also that the
   friend can inherit from private and protected members of this class. The name
   of the class that is used in this `friend` declaration does not need to be
   previously declared.

4) Designates the type named by the simple-type-specifier or typename-specifier
   as a friend of this class if that type is a (possibly cv-qualified) class,
   struct, or union; otherwise the `friend` declaration is ignored. This
   declaration will not forward declare a new type. class Y {}; class A { int
   data; // private data member class B {}; // private nested type enum { a =
   100 }; // private enumerator friend class X; // friend class forward
   declaration (elaborated class specifier) friend Y; // friend class
   declaration (simple type specifier) (since c++11) }; class X : A::B // OK:
   A::B accessible to friend { A::B mx; // OK: A::B accessible to member of
   friend class Y { A::B my; // OK: A::B accessible to nested member of friend
   }; int v[A::a]; // OK: A::a accessible to member of friend };

### Notes

Friendship is not transitive (a friend of your friend is not your friend).

Friendship is not inherited (your friend's children are not your friends, and
your friends are not your children's friends).

Storage class specifiers are not allowed in friend function declarations. A
function that is defined in the friend declaration has external linkage, a
function that was previously defined, keeps the linkage it was defined with.

Access specifiers have no effect on the meaning of friend declarations (they can
appear in `private:` or in `public:` sections, with no difference).

A friend class declaration cannot define a new class (`friend class X {};` is an
error).

When a local class declares an unqualified function or class as a friend, only
functions and classes in the innermost non-class scope are looked up, not the
global functions:

```cpp
class F {};

int f();

int main()
{
    extern int g();

    class Local // Local class in the main() function
    {
        friend int f(); // Error, no such function declared in main()
        friend int g(); // OK, there is a declaration for g in main()
        friend class F; // friends a local F (defined later)
        friend class ::F; // friends the global F
    };

    class F {}; // local F
}
```

A name first declared in a friend declaration within a class or class template
`X` becomes a member of the innermost enclosing namespace of `X`, but is not
visible for lookup (except argument-dependent lookup that considers `X`) unless
a matching declaration at namespace scope is provided - see namespaces for
details.

### Template friends

Both function template and class template declarations may appear with the
`friend` specifier in any non-local class or class template (although only
function templates may be defined within the class or class template that is
granting friendship). In this case, every specialization of the template becomes
a friend, whether it is implicitly instantiated, partially specialized, or
explicitly specialized.

```cpp
class A
{
    template<typename T>
    friend class B; // every B<T> is a friend of A

    template<typename T>
    friend void f(T) {} // every f<T> is a friend of A
};
```

Friend declarations cannot refer to partial specializations, but can refer to
full specializations:

```cpp
template<class T>
class A {};      // primary

template<class T>
class A<T*> {};  // partial

template<>
class A<int> {}; // full

class X
{
    template<class T>
    friend class A<T*>;  // error!

    friend class A<int>; // OK
};
```

When a friend declaration refers to a full specialization of a function
template, the keywords `inline`/`constexpr`(since C++11)/`consteval`(since
C++20) and default arguments cannot be used:

```cpp
template<class T>
void f(int);

template<>
void f<int>(int);

class X
{
    friend void f<int>(int x = 1); // error: default args not allowed
};
```

A template friend declaration can name a member of a class template A, which can
be either a member function or a member type (the type must use
elaborated-type-specifier). Such declaration is only well-formed if the last
component in its nested-name-specifier (the name to the left of the last `::`)
is a simple-template-id (template name followed by argument list in angle
brackets) that names the class template. The template parameters of such
template friend declaration must be deducible from the simple-template-id.

In this case, the member of any specialization of either A or partial
specializations of A becomes a friend. This does not involve instantiating the
primary template A or partial specializations of A: the only requirements are
that the deduction of the template parameters of A from that specialization
succeeds, and that substitution of the deduced template arguments into the
friend declaration produces a declaration that would be a valid redeclaration of
the member of the specialization:

```cpp
// primary template
template<class T>
struct A
{
    struct B {};

    void f();

    struct D { void g(); };

    T h();

    template<T U>
    T i();
};

// full specialization
template<>
struct A<int>
{
    struct B {};

    int f();

    struct D { void g(); };

    template<int U>
    int i();
};

// another full specialization
template<>
struct A<float*>
{
    int *h();
};

// the non-template class granting friendship to members of class template A
class X
{
    template<class T>
    friend struct A<T>::B; // all A<T>::B are friends, including A<int>::B

    template<class T>
    friend void A<T>::f(); // A<int>::f() is not a friend because its signature
                           // does not match, but e.g. A<char>::f() is a friend

//  template<class T>
//  friend void A<T>::D::g(); // ill-formed, the last part of the nested-name-specifier,
//                            // D in A<T>::D::, is not simple-template-id

    template<class T>
    friend int* A<T*>::h(); // all A<T*>::h are friends:
                            // A<float*>::h(), A<int*>::h(), etc

    template<class T>
    template<T U>       // all instantiations of A<T>::i() and A<int>::i() are friends,
    friend T A<T>::i(); // and thereby all specializations of those function templates
};
```

Default template arguments are only allowed on template friend declarations if
the declaration is a definition and no other declarations of this function
template appear in this translation unit.
*(since C++11)*

### Template friend operators

A common use case for template friends is declaration of a non-member operator
overload that acts on a class template, e.g. `operator<<(std::ostream&, const
Foo<T>&)` for some user-defined `Foo<T>`.

Such operator can be defined in the class body, which has the effect of
generating a separate non-template `operator<<` for each `T` and makes that
non-template `operator<<` a friend of its `Foo<T>`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template<typename T>
class Foo
{
public:
    Foo(const T& val) : data(val) {}
private:
    T data;

    // generates a non-template operator<< for this T
    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Foo& obj)
    {
        return os << obj.data;
    }
};

int main()
{
    Foo<double> obj(1.23);
    std::cout << obj << '\n';
}
```

Output:

```text
1.23
```

or the function template has to be declared as a template before the class body,
in which case the friend declaration within `Foo<T>` can refer to the full
specialization of `operator<<` for its `T`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template<typename T>
class Foo; // forward declare to make function declaration possible

template<typename T> // declaration
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream&, const Foo<T>&);

template<typename T>
class Foo
{
public:
    Foo(const T& val) : data(val) {}
private:
    T data;

    // refers to a full specialization for this particular T
    friend std::ostream& operator<< <> (std::ostream&, const Foo&);

    // note: this relies on template argument deduction in declarations
    // can also specify the template argument with operator<< <T>"
};

// definition
template<typename T>
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Foo<T>& obj)
{
    return os << obj.data;
}

int main()
{
    Foo<double> obj(1.23);
    std::cout << obj << '\n';
}
```

### Example

Stream insertion and extraction operators are often declared as non-member
friends:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

class MyClass
{
    int i;                   // friends have access to non-public, non-static
    static inline int id{6}; // and static (possibly inline) members

    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const MyClass&);
    friend std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& in, MyClass&);
    friend void change_id(int);
public:
    MyClass(int i = 0) : i(i) {}
};

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const MyClass& mc)
{
    return out << "MyClass::id = " << MyClass::id << "; i = " << mc.i;
}

std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& in, MyClass& mc)
{
    return in >> mc.i;
}

void change_id(int id) { MyClass::id = id; }

int main()
{
    MyClass mc(7);
    std::cout << mc << '\n';
//  mc.i = 333*2;  // error: i is a private member
    std::istringstream("100") >> mc;
    std::cout << mc << '\n';
//  MyClass::id = 222*3;  // error: id is a private member
    change_id(9);
    std::cout << mc << '\n';
}
```

Output:

```text
MyClass::id = 6; i = 7
MyClass::id = 6; i = 100
MyClass::id = 9; i = 100
```
