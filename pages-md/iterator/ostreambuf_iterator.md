# std::ostreambuf_iterator

```cpp
template< class CharT, class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT> >
class ostreambuf_iterator
    : public std::iterator<std::output_iterator_tag, void, void, void, void>  // (until C++17)
template< class CharT, class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT> >
class ostreambuf_iterator;  // (since C++17)
```

`std::ostreambuf_iterator` is a single-pass LegacyOutputIterator that writes
successive characters into the `std::basic_streambuf` object for which it was
constructed. The actual write operation is performed when the iterator (whether
dereferenced or not) is assigned to. Incrementing the `std::ostreambuf_iterator`
is a no-op.

In a typical implementation, the only data members of `std::ostreambuf_iterator`
are a pointer to the associated `std::basic_streambuf` and a boolean flag
indicating if the end of file condition has been reached.

### Member types

- **`iterator_category`** — std::output_iterator_tag
- **`value_type`** — void
- **`difference_type`** — void (until C++20) `std::ptrdiff_t` (since C++20)
- **void** — (until C++20)
- **`std::ptrdiff_t`** — (since C++20)
- **`pointer`** — void
- **`reference`** — void
- **`char_type`** — `CharT`
- **`traits_type`** — `Traits`
- **`streambuf_type`** — std::basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits>
- **`ostream_type`** — std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>

Member types `iterator_category`, `value_type`, `difference_type`, `pointer` and
`reference` are required to be obtained by inheriting from
std::iterator<std::output_iterator_tag, void, void, void, void>.
*(until C++17)*

### Member functions

- **(constructor)** — constructs a new `ostreambuf_iterator` (public member
  function)
- **(destructor) (implicitly declared)** — destructs an `ostreambuf_iterator`
  (public member function)
- **operator=** — writes a character to the associated output sequence (public
  member function)
- **operator*** — no-op (public member function)
- **operator++operator++(int)** — no-op (public member function)
- **failed** — tests if output failed (public member function)

### Example

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string s = "This is an example\n";
    std::copy(s.begin(), s.end(), std::ostreambuf_iterator<char>(std::cout));
}
```

Output:

```text
This is an example
```
