# std::numeric_limits<T>::is_bounded

```cpp
static const bool is_bounded;  // (until C++11)
static constexpr bool is_bounded;  // (since C++11)
```

The value of `std::numeric_limits<T>::is_bounded` is `true` for all arithmetic
types `T` that represent a finite set of values. While all fundamental types are
bounded, this constant would be `false` in a specialization of
`std::numeric_limits` for a library-provided arbitrary precision arithmetic
type.
